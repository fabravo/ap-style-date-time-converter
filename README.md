# Wordpress AP Style Date and Time Converter
A Wordpress Plugin to converts dates and times displayed on the site to AP Style dynamically, including Gutenberg blocks

## Background
I'm [Frank Bravo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabravo) and I am a [technologist](https://www.bravoitc.com). My regular full-time job is CTO at a hyper-local, non-profit media organization, the [Embarcadero Media Foundation](https://www.EmbarcaderoMediaFoundation.org) in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2024, we migrated our home-grown CMS to a Wordpress-based system. Since our vendor didn't have a way to present datelines in AP Style date/time format, I built my own.

## Requirements
Change the date to a custom format like this: F j, Y g:i a
You will find it under the Settings menu, under General.
